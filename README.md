🌊 I'm a data-driven marine scientist with a passion for analyzing biological data and contributing to open science. 

🌱 I'm constantly jumping from project to project, trying to answer biological questions. 

🌈 My repositories may seem like a rainbow puke, a colorful mix of unconnected but intriguing scientific projects that reflect my interests.
